# Git cheat sheet

## Stashing

See also http://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing

##### Stash your work

    git stash

This will result in a clean working directory.

##### See list of stored stashes

    git stash list

Newer entries are on top and have a lower number in `stash@{3}`. Dates of stashes can be seen using:

    git stash list --date=local

##### Apply a stash

Get a preview what applying a stash will look like (from http://stackoverflow.com/q/7677736 ):

    git stash show -p stash@{0}

Apply the most recent stash:  

    git stash apply

Apply the most recent stash and re-stage files that were staged when stashing:  

    git stash apply --index

Apply the most recent stash and remove it from the stash stack:

    git stash pop

Apply an older stash:  

    git stash apply stash@{3}

##### Un-apply a stash

    git stash show -p stash@{3} | git apply -R

or shorter for the most recent stash:

    git stash show -p | git apply -R

##### Create a new branch from a stash

    git stash branch mynewbranch

This drops the stash.

##### Remove a stash from the list of stashes

    git stash drop stash@{2}

or shorter for the most recent stash:

    git stash drop
